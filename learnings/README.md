# Learnings

Cross-project technical learnings captured via `/workflows:compound`.

## Structure

Learnings organized by category:
- `workflow/` — Development workflow patterns
- `integration/` — System integration lessons
- `architecture/` — Architectural decisions

## Adding Learnings

1. Run `/workflows:compound` after solving a problem
2. Learning captured in project's `docs/solutions/`
3. Significant learnings synced here for portfolio-wide discovery
